# Web Development Project 5 - _Dashboard: Brewery_

Submitted by: **Jing Wang**

This web app: **A brewery data dashboard that provides an at-a-glance summary of information gathered from a public API, [openbrewerydb.org](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/). The dashboard view contains summary statistics and a list view of the data that can be searched and filtered.**

Time spent: **3 + 5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The site has a dashboard displaying a list of data fetched using an API call**
  - The dashboard should display at least 10 unique items, one per row
  - The dashboard includes at least two features in each row
- [x] **`useEffect` React hook and `async`/`await` are used**
- [x] **The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data**
  - The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data, such as:
    - _insert details here_
- [x] **A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data**
  - The search bar **correctly** filters items in the list, only displaying items matching the search query
  - The list of results dynamically updates as the user types into the search bar
- [x] **An additional filter allows the user to restrict displayed items by specified categories**
  - The filter restricts items in the list using a **different attribute** than the search bar
  - The filter **correctly** filters items in the list, only displaying items matching the filter attribute in the dashboard
  - The dashboard list dynamically updates as the user adjusts the filter

The following **additional** **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Clicking on an item in the list view displays more details about it**
  - Clicking on an item in the dashboard list navigates to a detail view for that item
  - Detail view includes extra information about the item not included in the dashboard view
  - The same sidebar is displayed in detail view as in dashboard view
  - *To ensure an accurate grade, your sidebar **must** be viewable when showing the details view in your recording.*
- [x] **Each detail view of an item has a direct, unique URL link to that item’s detail view page**
  -  *To ensure an accurate grade, the URL/address bar of your web browser **must** be viewable in your recording.*
- [x] **The app includes at least two unique charts developed using the fetched data that tell an interesting story**
  - At least two charts should be incorporated into the dashboard view of the site
  - Each chart should describe a different aspect of the dataset

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously
- [x] Filters use different input types
  - e.g., as a text input, a dropdown or radio selection, and/or a slider
- [ ] The user can enter specific bounds for filter values


The following **additional** **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] The site’s customized dashboard contains more content that explains what is interesting about the data 
  - e.g., an additional description, graph annotation, suggestion for which filters to use, or an additional page that explains more about the data
- [x] The site allows users to toggle between different data visualizations
  - User should be able to use some mechanism to toggle between displaying and hiding visualizations

## Notes

The project came together nicely overall. The main challenge I faced was handling the dynamic API requests, constructing the appropriate URL endpoints when users search by state or filter by brewery type.
